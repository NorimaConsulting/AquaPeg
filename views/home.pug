      h2 Next Steps
      p We have some big plans for this project. If this idea proves to be meaningful to Winnipeggers, we plan to add a few features:
      ul
       li Take a photo with your smart phone, and have the reading entered automatically.
       li Monitor your home water usage with personal graphs.
       li Customize reminder schedules so you can report as often or little as you wish.
       li Better checking of results from the City of Winnipeg phone system to ensure accuracy.
